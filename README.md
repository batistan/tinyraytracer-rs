### About

Minimal ray tracer implemented in Rust, following https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer

Credit to https://github.com/NeuroWhAI/tinyraytracer-rs/blob/master/src/vector.rs for operator overloading code

### Running

Run `cargo run`, optionally with `--release` flag to optimize. Output is a `.ppm` image file in the same directory, which you can open in most mainstream image viewers.
